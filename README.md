My entry for the Ludum Dare 43 compo

This game was made in 48h during the Ludum Dare 43 game jam (https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/landscape-manager).

In this game you’ll play as an applier for the role of Lead Landscape Developpment Architect Manager. You’ll be tested on your skill : use your mouse to cut down unnecessary leaves, and try to get the requested number of flowers. This game is quite hard, you should expect to restart some levels a couple of times.

Tools used : Unity, Audacity, Bfxr, Bosca Ceoil, PyxelEdit, Aseprite.

Available on Google Play store : https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/landscape-manager
